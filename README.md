  A Hypercharged, fast modern clipboard 
</p>

## Introduction
As a developer I spend a lot of my time copy pasting stuff. I wanted to make it simple. My initial goto tool was CopyClip which lacked keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys. Then I used Cutbox which had both but the search was painstakingly slow. So here it is, a fast, goodlooking clipboard manager built with Electron.

## Features

* Fast ðŸš€From loading the popup to searching, everything is a breeze.
* Dark Mode! Yes!
* Works with a global shortcut `âŒ˜+Shift+L`
* Unlimited scrollback.
* Shortcuts for the last 10 clipboard items
* Start on boot
* Built with React and React Select
* Started from Electrojet boilerpolate
* FREE!

## Installation

Download the DMG from Github Releases

## Usage

* Double click the icon to start the app.
* App will automatically hide on start. Press the global hotkey `âŒ˜ + Shift + L` to bring up the clipboard.
* Search or use arrow keys to navigate.
* Press Enter to copy it to clipboard again. Or alternatively use the shortcuts `âŒ˜ + 0` - `âŒ˜ + 9` to copy them!
