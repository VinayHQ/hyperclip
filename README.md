  A Hypercharged, fast and modern clipboard 
</p>

## Introduction
As a developer I spend a lot of my time copy pasting stuff. I wanted to make it simple. My initial goto tool was CopyClip which lacked keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys. Then I used Cutbox which had both but the search was painstakingly slow. So here it is, a fast, goodlooking clipboard manager built with Electron.

#### Current Version
##### macOS Beta - <a href="https://github.com/o-my-code/hyperclip/releases/download/Beta/HyperClip.dmg">Download Now</a>

## Features

* Fast ðŸš€From loading the popup to searching, everything is a breeze.
* Dark Mode! Yes!
* Works with a global shortcut `âŒ˜+Shift+L`
* Shortcuts for the last 10 clipboard items
* Start on boot
* Built with React and React Select
* Started from <a href="https://github.com/o-my-code/electrojet">Electrojet</a> boilerpolate
